            This is going to be another absolutely amazing GCI year! We have a long and proud history of taking part in the Google Summer of Code with university students, and are excited to participate in GCI again for the 4th year with pre-university students!<br /><br />
              While it is completely optional, it is highly recommended that you join our <a class="pagesLinks" href="#slack">Slack</a> group. All the mentors, org admins, contributors and fellow GCI participants hang out in that group. That's the best place to get quick answers to any query or problem you might have.<hr />
            <sub>Can't join the Slack group? It's no problem! We try to be super fast to respond to all comments and submissions in the GCI website. If you prefer email, you can email us at code-in@ccextractor.org. There's also a mailing list/Google group for CCExtractor: <a class="pagesLinks" href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ccextractor-dev">https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ccextractor-dev</a> if that's how you sail!</sub>

If we, as an organization, are invited to GSoC 2020 the applications from successful Code-in students will go to the top of pile. <br /><br />
                        We also give back to our students in any way we can, including writing recommendation letters that can help to apply to universities, visas, jobs and so on.<br />

                      <p>
                        &emsp;We are doing this to prevent the design tasks being treated just as an easy way to complete beginner tasks. For example, you can create a T-Shirt design in 10 minutes, but that's very unlikely to be good and usable to well, actually make T-Shirts with it.
                        We did this in 2017 and 2018 and got some amazing results. One of our winners from 2017 did some major design tasks including the current organization logo and the site you are on right now
                          was designed last year.<br /><br />
                        Remember though that hard means hard. Don't expect us to approve the first design you come up with. We will give you feedback and work with you until you produce something that you can be proud of for years and that we can use.

                          &emsp;Yes, we get this from time to time &#128578; We know there's lots of cool languages out there, many really easy to start with, and well, C is not one of them. But the thing is, the most performance critical tools are written in C, such as the Linux kernel, or FFmpeg, or… you get the idea. A tool that needs to process lots of data (such as video) just needs to be as efficient as possible.<br /><br />
                          &emsp;We do have auxiliary tools written in different languages, for example the Windows GUI is written in C#, and we have lots of Python as well. But the core CCExtractor tool is in C. Should you learn C then? Well, depends on how serious you are with IT in general. By learning it you will learn a lot of how things really work - without using all the magic that higher level languages provide.

                          We think that the best way to let you know how cool Code-in is is to show you a video of previous winners. This was at Google's office in San Francisco in 2017, where Evgeny and Alexandru (which are of course now core developers at CCExtractor) presented what they did during GCI 2016!
